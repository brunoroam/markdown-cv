# Franco D. Sioquim

Customer delight and usability is what I love to focus when working on a product. 
I am a software engineer with a wide spectrum of technologies and languages - from VHDL to Javascript. I'm passionate about web development and helping out teams through mentoring, knowledge on modern technologies, and problem solving are the things.
